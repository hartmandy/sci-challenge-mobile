# SWU Card Gallery Dev Challenge ðŸ‘‹

Hello SCI team, here is the React Native app! To run you need to clone the repository, npm or yarn install, and use the proxy listed below.

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   ```bash
   # The app requires a proxy for API access
   yarn web-with-proxy   # For web development
   # or
   yarn ios-with-proxy   # For iOS
   # or
   yarn android-with-proxy # For Android
   ```

### Problem-Solving Approach

- _Fixed test issues_ First thing I saw was the test failures. I saw a variable 'card_meta' was unused. The api test was failing because it didnâ€™t match the mock data, so I updated that.
- _Project/ Dep Setup_ I installed native wind (tailwind for react native) and react-native-reusables (shadcn for react native) so I could pull over components I built for the web app. I worked on routing/navigation first, simplifying it to have just the two tabs for this exercise, Card Search and Saved Cards.
- _Color Theme_ I set up the color theme first, since I was working on the tabs and header in the layout file.

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Tasks

my notes

- Routing is wrong, no initial screen
- Toggle light and dark mode, icons working with light and dark mode

Remaining tasks

1. **Fix and Run**:

   - Ensure proper data fetching and display

2. **Enhance the UI**:

   - Add animations to the cards (e.g., on hover, sort, or load)
   - Consider using react-native-reanimated or your preferred animation approach
   - Optimize the layout for both mobile and web views

3. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Consider implementing loading states
   - Handle edge cases in data fetching
   - Optimize sorting operations

- Consider adding features like:

  - Dark mode support
  - Loading animations
  - Improved error handling
  - Search functionality
  - Responsive design improvements
